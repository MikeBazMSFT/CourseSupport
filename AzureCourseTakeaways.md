# Azure Course Take-aways

Last updated: May 13, 2020

## Intro

This is a set of information I discuss with classes as part of my "end of class" summary when I am presenting Azure Microsoft Official Curriculum.  These are personal opinions and are not the official position of Microsoft.  I update this document on occasion based on new information, class feedback, etc. - you can use the update date at the top to tell you the last change and use the GitHub revision history to see what has changed.

## Learning Resources

* The following resources are in the "standard" opening deck for Azure Technical Trainer deliveries:
  * [Microsoft Certification Overview](https://www.microsoft.com/certification) covers information across Microsoft certifications.
  * [Microsoft Official Curriculum](https://aka.ms/MOC) is the courseware used for deliveries.
  * [Microsoft Learn](https://www.microsoft.com/learn) is our hosted, bite-sized ("microlearning"), lab-inclusive self-paced training environment.
  * The [Azure Architecture Center](https://aka.ms/Architecture) covers different scenarios with recommended design guidance.
  * A [training and certification poster](https://aka.ms/TrainCertPoster) is out there to help you see the big picture.
  * The [Microsoft Docs](https://aka.ms/Docs) is the official documentation site for all Microsoft products.
* [Skillpipe e-Book access](https://www.skillpipe.com) - available "forever" and updated on a regular basis for the life of the course.
* Most Azure course [labs](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftLearningGitHub) are on GitHub; the Azure DevOps course for the most part uses the [Azure DevOps Labs](https://aka.ms/ADOLabs/) site as referenced in my [lab TOC](https://aka.ms/az400labs) for that course.
* [Microsoft Hands-on Labs](https://aka.ms/MicrosoftHOL) is a collection of hosted VMs for lots of different lab scenarios, both Azure and not.
* [Azure Courses on EdX](https://aka.ms/AzureEdX) is another source of self-paced online learning, but is closer to traditional timing than the shorter-form content on Microsoft Learn.
* Microsoft has sponsored several courses on Pluralsight
  * [Microsoft Azure Developer](https://aka.ms/PluralsightAzureDeveloper)
  * [Microsoft Azure Solution Architect](https://aka.ms/PluralsightAzureArchitect)
  * [Microsoft Azure Administrator](https://aka.ms/PluralsightAzureAdministrator)
* A summary presentation of all [Microsoft Training and Certifications](https://aka.ms/TrainCertSummary) is available.

## Study Guides

* My team has created study materials:
  * [AZ-900](https://aka.ms/attaz900guide)

* Cloud Advocate Thomas Maurer has put together study guides for several exams:
  * [AZ-104](https://aka.ms/TMAz104)
  * [AZ-204](https://aka.ms/TMAz204)
  * [AZ-220](https://aka.ms/TMAz220)
  * [AZ-303](https://aka.ms/TMAz303)
  * [AZ-304](https://aka.ms/TMAz304)
  * [AZ-900](https://aka.ms/TMAz900)

## Exam Tips

* Details on different question types including videos for them are at the top-level [Microsoft Certification Exams](https://aka.ms/QuestionTypes) web site.  There's also a [FAQ](https://aka.ms/CertificationFAQ) there with a lot of common questions and answers.
* A [blog post](https://aka.ms/homeexam) about the home testing experience was posted by one of Microsoft's Cloud Advocates, Thomas Maurer.
* In most cases, you will receive exam results immediately at the end of the exam, after the comment period.  For beta exams and some exams that have practical components, there will be a delay - beta exams will be scored after the beta period ends, while practical exams may be delayed by a couple of hours.  Delayed results will be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Microsoft Learning profile.
* These are not college entrance exams.  You are not penalized for wrong answers.  Thus, if you don't know an answer, don't leave it blank - guess.
* The exams are not trying to trick you - don't read too far into the question.
* Don't second-guess your answers.  Your first feeling is usually right.
* You can find practice exams at [MindHub](https://aka.ms/BuyPracticeExams).
* Watch your time, especially in exams that have a practical component.  Time can go very quickly.
* Don't read and memorize a case study.  Either:
  * Skim the case study briefly to learn where things are, then go to the questions.
  * Skim the questions to see what is being asked, then find the answers in the case study.
* Any comments you make during the comment period are read by a human being - every single one.  So, if you have a complaint, be clear, concise, and polite in your comment, so it can be acted upon.
* Remember that exams are "pass/fail," meaning although you get a numeric score to help you understand your weaknesses, nobody will ever see the score but you, so don't get hung up too much on it.
