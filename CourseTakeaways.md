# Intro

This is a set of information I discuss with classes as part of my "end of class" summary when I am presenting Azure Microsoft Official Curriculum.  These are personal opinions and are not the official position of Microsoft.  I update this document on occasion based on new information, class feedback, etc. - you can use the revision number at the top of the Gist page to track changes over time.

# Exam Tips

* These are not college entrance exams.  You are not penalized for wrong answers.  Thus, if you don't know an answer, don't leave it blank - guess. 
* The exams are not trying to trick you - don't read too far into the question.
* Don't second-guess your answers.  Your first feeling is usually right.
* You can find practice exams at https://www.mindhub.com.  
* Watch your time, especially in exams that have a practical component.  Time can go very quickly.
* Don't read and memorize a case study.  Either:
   * Skim the case study briefly to learn where things are, then go to the questions.
   * Skim the questions to see what is being asked, then find the answers in the case study.
* Any comments you make during the comment period are read by a human being - every single one.  So, if you have a complaint, be clear, concise, and polite in your comment, so it can be acted upon.
* Remember that exams are "pass/fail," meaning although you get a numeric score to help you understand your weaknesses, nobody will ever see the score but you, so don't get hung up too much on it.
