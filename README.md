# Course Support

This is a collection of miscellaneous files around Microsoft Official Curriculum MOC courses and labs that I use in
various circumstances.

* [`Az400LabList.md`](Az400LabList.md)	is a "table of contents" for the labs of the AZ-400 course.
* [`AzureCourseTakeaways.md`](AzureCourseTakeaways.md) is my "End of course" link summmary.
* [`NoCurrentSurvey.md`](NoCurrentSurvey.md) is a placeholder page used for survey shortcut links.
* [`NoCurrentClass.md`](NoCurrentClass.md) is a placeholder page used for class shortcut links.
